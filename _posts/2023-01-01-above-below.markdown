## How do you know if you're above or below the line?
How we approach people, teams, and organizations makes a lot of difference.  Being open, curious and committed to learning (above the line) will make us effective leaders.  If we are closed, defensive, and committed to being right (below the line) then we will be less effective.  Am I above or below the line?<br>
## Instructions

Take the first 2 minutes for silent self reflection
1. Think of a person, team, or group that you have interacted with in the last 2 months.
2. Pick at least one specific interaction with them.  Remember how you felt during the interaction(s).
3. Compare your experience with the descriptions on the worksheet.  Were the statements, behaviours, beliefs that you felt more like those *above* the line, or more like those *below* the line?

Take the next 5 minutes to share your self observations with your group
1. How did you feel?
2. How was your experience similar to that of others?  How was it different?
